      <Step title="Started dsmtech.io 🤘🏻">
        Reflecting on my recent job search, I realized there wasn't a
        centralized listing of all the Des Moines tech companies. So...I created
        it.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Joined Hy-Vee 🛒">
        It was time for a change in my career, and Hy-Vee came calling. The best
        part was reducing my commute time by an hour/day.

        One of my most cherished accomplishments. I worked my ass off to get
        this degree.

      <Step title="Family Roadtrip 🚗">
        To celebrate graduating, my family and I did a road trip down the

      <Step title="Full-Time at Workiva">
        I was offered and accepted a full-time offer with Workiva, as well as
        the opportunity to continue my internship until graduation.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Moved to Des Moines 🏙">
        I moved Downtown DSM into a quaint 1BR apartment. Des Moines has always
        felt like home growing up ~45 minutes away.

        This internship meant a lot to me. Being able to work part-time while
        still getting my school work done was huge.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Started Tutoring Programming">
        Why not make a little extra money and sharpen my skills? I taught Python
        to ISU Freshman.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Second Internship">
        Spent the summer in (beautiful?) Cedar Rapids, IA working at Rockwell

        Finally felt like I understood this whole programming thing. My

      <Step title="Started at Iowa State University 🌪❤️">
        I've been a die-hard Cyclone fan my whole life. It was a no-brainer that
        I was going to ISU, especially since they have a great Engineering
        program.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Learned How To Program">
        CS 101. Our professor asked a simple question - "Who here has prior
        programming experience?". About 80% of the class raised their hands. I
        knew it was going to be an uphill battle from here.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wanted To Dropout of College">
        I didn't pick up programming right away. It didn't help we learned C to
        start – I'm glad I stuck with it, though.
